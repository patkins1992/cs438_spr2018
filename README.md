This repo is for my group to use for our cs438 AI course at SIUE.


Notes from Justin 02/23/18
1)As long as Justins_player.py, Tron.py, and Tron_power_up.py are in the same folder,
you should be able to run Tron_power_up.py and see a game play out.
2) You can adjust the number of players by changing the number of initilized player objects 
in the list_of_players variable in Tron_power_up.py. and the grid size can be adjusted by
changing the grid_size variable.
3)The goal is that each one of us can make our own Name_players.py files that can be included
into the Tron_power_up.py. For an example see my Justins_player.py.
4) overriding the move() function is the one must do, this is where the "brains of your player 
will go.
5)Once your players "brain" is in place then the file can be included to Tron_power_up.py
and added to the list_of_players variable.
6)See if the player runs.
